# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling of Tweets about COVID-19
I collaborated with Laibah Iqbal on this senior year research project. Under the supervision of Dr. Ussama Yaqub, we anayzed text data in the form of twitter tweets, looking at the common topics of discussion as well as the sentiment. We specifically looked at tweets in North America (USA, Canada, and Mexico), predominantly in the USA. In terms of the time period, we looked at tweets during the first wave, the spread of the delta variant, and when vaccinations began to roll out. 

The data was sourced from Zenodo (link below.)
